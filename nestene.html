    <h1>The Nestene Consciousness</h1>
    <p>
    The Nestene Consciousness, also known as the Nestenes and as Mother
    Consciousness to its Autons, was a disembodied life force, a hive mind race
    and a singular entity existing as energy with the ability to possess
    plastic. The Third Doctor described the Nestenes as "ruthlessly aggressive
    [and] intelligent."

    <h3>BIOLOGY</h3>
    <p>
    The Nestene Consciousness could manifest itself either as the same solid
    plastic an Auton was made out of, as it did in its first invasion of Earth,
    or as a creature of "pure force and energy", as it did during the second
    invasion. Its appearance was of a many-tentacled monster which was
    "something between spider, crab and octopus".
